# BATTLE SHIP GAME P3

## ABOUT THIS WEBSITE

Battleships is a classic two-player strategy game where each player has a fleet of ships and they take turns guessing the coordinates to try and sink their opponent's ships. The objective of the game is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink all of yours. The game is played on a grid where each player secretly places their ships. The players then take turns guessing the coordinates of the other player's ships, marking a hit or a miss on their own grid. The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.

## HOW TO PLAY

-The aim of the game is to sink the enemy battleship that is hidden, by guessing row and column coordinates each turn. 
- Player inputs his or her name and the game starts.
- In this Battleship Game, there is a single ship hidden in a random location on a 5x5 grid. 
- The player will have 10 guesses to try to sink the ship
- The columns are numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and rows are numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). 

## USER EXPERIENCE (UX)

### User Stories 

- As a user I want to be able to play the battleship game.
- As a user I want to be able to clone this game. 

### Design 

## FEATURES

There is a system in place that prevents the player from attacking their own ship, selecting an already entered coordinate either by the player or enemy or selecting an invalid number. 

The computer is also prevented from selecting an invalid or already entered coordinate. In the event the player sinks the enemy ship first, they win, and the game tells the user how many attempts it took for the player to win. If the enemy wins then the game tells you how many attempts it took the computer to win. 

Termcolor has also been installed to





### Future Features

Additional features in the near future shall include information on Michael Jordan's charity programmes and merchandizing. 

## TESTING

This website was tested using CI Python Linter Validator by Code Institute 

### Validator Testing 

- PEP8 Validator 
There were no errors found as seen here:

### Responsiveness Test

The responsive design tests were carried out manually with [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) and [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/). 
The following devices were all tested and passed: Desktop 15-24", Galaxy S5-S7, Galaxy A, iPhone 3-7, Sony Z2-Z3, iPad and iPad Mini

### Browser Compatibility

The Game was succcesfully tested on the following browsers and there no errors found. Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox. Responsiveness were consistent on all above mentioned browsers and devices.

### Fixed Bugs

No bugs found  

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

- HTML5 - provides the structure and content for the website.
- Gitpod - workstation used for creating game in run.py file.
- Github - used for hosting and editing the website.
- Heroku - used for deployment of the game 


## DEPLOYMENT

The Game was deployed on Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows:

Config Vars and buildpacks heroku/python and heroku/nodejs were added in Heroku settings:
