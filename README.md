# Game Introduction

Battleships is a classic two-player strategy game where each player has a fleet of ships and they take turns guessing the coordinates to try and sink their opponent's ships. The objective of the game is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink all of yours. The game is played on a grid where each player secretly places their ships. The players then take turns guessing the coordinates of the other player's ships, marking a hit or a miss on their own grid. The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.
